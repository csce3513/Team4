===============
\\\\HERO\\\\\\
===============
I made 8 portraits, all of which are 200x200
Four of these are male, four of these are female

They are labeled with H_##, H represents "Hero".
I have not decided on what element they should 
be yet so that's up for voting.

===============
\\\\MONSTERS\\\
===============

Every file is encoded in the format of M_#_#
M means Monster, the first number represents the 
level of which the monster will appear and the 
second number is the order number given to the monsters

===============
\\\\SPRITES\\\\
===============

This is a collection of sprites I have cut out, I'm not
sure where we could use these but since I put some work
into it I thought it'd be a waste to just trash it. maybe
we'll find a use later?
